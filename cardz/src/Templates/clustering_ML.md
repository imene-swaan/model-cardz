## Model Details

The model was created using Scikit-Learn's {{ model_algorithm }} algorithm with the following settings:

- **Number of Clusters:** {{ model_hyperparameters.n_clusters }}
- **Init Method:** {{ model_hyperparameters.init }}
- **Number of Initializations:** {{ model_hyperparameters.n_init }}
- **Maximum Number of Iterations:** {{ model_hyperparameters.max_iter }}
- **Tolerance for Convergence:** {{ model_hyperparameters.tol }}

### Preprocessing Steps

The following preprocessing steps were performed on the data prior to clustering:

{% for step in preprocessing_steps %}
- {{ step }}
{% endfor %}

### Clustering Results

The following table shows the clustering results:

| Sample | Cluster |
|--------|---------|
{% for sample, cluster in clustering_results %}
| {{ sample }} | {{ cluster }} |
{% endfor %}

### Silhouette Score

The Silhouette score is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A score of 1 indicates that the object is well-matched to its own cluster and poorly-matched to neighboring clusters. A score of -1 indicates that the object is poorly-matched to its own cluster and well-matched to neighboring clusters. A score of 0 indicates that the object is on the border between two clusters. The Silhouette score for this model is {{ silhouette_score }}.

### Cluster Metrics

The following metrics were calculated for each cluster:

{% for metric in cluster_metrics %}
- {{ metric }}
{% endfor %}

### Cluster Visualization

The following visualization shows the cluster distribution:

![Cluster Distribution]({{ cluster_distribution_plot.file_path }})

### Data Description

The data used to train the model consists of {{ data_description.num_samples }} samples, each with {{ data_description.num_features }} features.

### Data Distribution

The following plots show the distribution of the data:

{% for plot in data_distribution_plots %}
- {{ plot.title }}
![{{ plot.title }}]({{ plot.file_path }})
{% endfor %}

### Data Preprocessing Steps

The following preprocessing steps were performed on the data prior to clustering:

{% for step in data_preprocessing_steps %}
- {{ step }}
{% endfor %}
